#addition: c = a + b
#subtraction: c = a - b
#multiplication: c = a * b
#division: c = a / b

    #Examples:
    #Math Operations with Two Variables:
number_spiders = 10
number_legs = 8

total_legs = number_spiders * number_legs
print(total_legs) #output is 80'

    #Math Operations Inside Print Statement:
number_butterflies = 25
print(number_butterflies + 15) #output is 40

#When dividing integers, you always get returned a float data type.
    #Example:
bees = 16
flowers = 2
answer = bees / flowers
print(answer) #outputs 8.0, a float, even though the number is an even 8.

#You can print equations as well, but if something is being multiplied by parentheses make sure to put an asterik between the integer and the parentheses.
    #Example:
print((3 * 5) * 4 + 9 - 5 * (4 - 3))

    #Modulus
#The "percent sign" is called Modulus in python. It is used to return the remainder values between two numbers being divided.
    #Examples:
fruits = 10 % 3
print(fruits)

number = 245
print(number % 2) #this returns a 1, which shows us that the variable number is assigned to an odd integer. If it were to return a 0, then we would know that the variable number is assigned to an even integer. This only works when using modulus with 2.
#Anything that returns a 0, we know that it is divided into a whole number by the input after the modulus.
#Modulus can also be used to find the last two numbers in a 3 digit number.
    #Example:
number = 245
print(number % 100) #this prints the last two digits of 245.

    #Using Integers in a List for Math
#You can use the index numbers of integer values in a list to do math with them. Always remember that indexes start from 0.
    #Example:
puppies = [2, 3, 6, 5, 10]
print(puppies[1] + 10) #this prints 13, the addition of index number 1 and the integer 10.
    
    #Rounding
#You can easily round values with the round() method.
    #Example:
pies = 10
shared = pies/3
print(round(shared, 2)) #this prints 3.33, the output of 10/3 rounded to the second decimal place.

    #Max and Min
#The easiest way to find maximum and minimum values from a list is to use the max() and min() methods.
    #Max Example 1:
data = max(4, 20, 63, 18, 9, 45)
print(data) #This prints 63, the largest value in the data set.
    #Min Example 1:
data = min(4, 20, 63, 18, 9, 45)
print(data) #This prints 4, the smallest value in the data set.
#You can also use the max() and min() methods in the print statement itself
    #Max Example 2:
data = [4, 20, 63, 18, 9, 45]
print(max(data))
    #Min Example 2:
data = [4, 20, 63, 18, 9, 45]
print(min(data))
#This way, you can use the same data set to get different values in said data set instead of having to create multiple different sets with the same data.
