#Whatever you want to get as input must have something to prompt the user.
name = input("What is your name? ")
#to print inputs with other pieces, you must put spaces and make sure that each piece that is being printed either has quotes, or is the name of a variable that recieved an input from the user previously. Make sure to add + between pieces that are being concatenated.
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
