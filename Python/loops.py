    #If Loops
#If statements are used to tell the program "if x occurs, do y"
#If statements start with the keyword "if", followed by a condition, and ending with a colon.
#After the colon, the next line is indented. This indicates to the program that if the conditions are met, the indented code is to be executed.
    #Example: (commented out to prevent errors if this program is run)
#if [condition]:
    #[other code to be run]
#Indenting is very important in Python. If your code is not properly indented, it will not run correctly and may even give you an error.
    
    #Comparison Operators
#A condition compares values using a comparison operator. Comparison operators are:
    #Greater than: >
    #Greater than or equal to: >=
    #Less than: <
    #Less than or equal to: <=
    #Equal to: ==
    #Not equal to: !=
#The greater than and less than operators are used for numbers only, but the equal to and not equal to operators can be used for numbers and strings.
    #Example:
Frank_age = 23
Bob_age = 40
if Bob_age > Frank_age:
    print("Bob is older than Frank")

    #Else Loops
#an else statement will catch everything that is not included in the If statement.
    #Example:
Janet_age = 16
Eva_age = 5
if Eva_age > Janet_age:
    print("Eva is older than Janet.")
else:
    print("Eva is younger than Janet.")

    #'=' Sign Usage
#A single '=' sign is used to declare a variable. A double '=' sign is used to check if a variable is the same as something.
    #Example:
Name = input("What is your name? ")
change = input("Would you like to change your name? ")
if change == "Yes":
    Name = input("What is your new name? ")
    print("Your name is now " + Name + "!")
else:
    print("Your name is " + Name + "!")
#See how '==' can be used to test user input? This is very useful in heavily user-input based programs.
#You can also use '==' to check if two variables are the same.
    #Example:
friend_pet = "poodle"
your_pet = "fish"
if friend_pet == your_pet:
    print("You and your friend have the same pet!")
else:
    print("You and your friend have different pets.")
#You can also check if two values are not equal using '!='.
    #Example:
friend_pet = "poodle"
your_pet = "fish"

if friend_pet != your_pet:
    print("You and your friends have different pets!")
else:
    print("You and your friend have the same pet!")

    #And Condition
#If you want to check if two different conditions are BOTH true, you can combine two condition statements by using 'and'. 
    #Example:
your_pet = "gerbil"
your_need = "exercise"
if your_pet == "dog" and your_need == "animal companion":
    print("You are allowed to bring your pet inside the store.")
else:
    print("You cannot bring your pet inside the store.")

    #Or Condition
#If you want to check if one of multiple conditions are true, then you can do so by using 'or'.
    #Example:
your_pet = "gerbil"
if your_pet == "fish" or your_pet == "reptile":
    print("You are allowed to bring your pet inside the classroom.")
else:
    print("You cannot bring your pet inside the classroom.")

    #Else If Loops
#Else If statements are used to combine multiple if statements. When you do this, you can add an Else if statement. Else if is shortened to elif.
    #Example:
price = 10
your_cash = 8

if your_cash > price:
    print("You have MORE than enough money to buy it.")
elif your_cash == price:
    print("You have exactly enough money to buy it.")
else:
    print("You do not have enough money to buy it.")
#You can also use multiple elif statements.
vacation = "mountains"
if vacation == "beach":
    print("You love the ocean")
elif vacation == "amusement park":
    print("You love to ride roller coasters")
elif vacation == "mountains":
    print("You love to get up and get away")
else:
    print("You like unique vacation destinations")

    #For Loops
#A for loop is used to address each piece of data in a sequence.
#It is a way to repeat a block of code multiple times, hence why it is called a 'loop'.
    #Example of Basic Structure: (commented out as to not give an error when the code is run)
sequence = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
for item in sequence:
    #do something with your item
    #'item' is a variable that takes the value of each element in the sequence, one at a time. This can be called anything, but it is important that it makes sense for your loop and is not too long.
    #'sequence' is the collection of items that you want to iterate over. This would be the name of your variable.
    #List Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number) #this will print '1 2 3 4 5' (each number on a separate line)
    #'numbers' is the list that we want to iterate over
    #'number' is the variable that takes each value from the list, one at a time.

    #String Example:
string = "hello world"
for char_ in string:
    print(char_) #this will print each character in the string that is assigned to the variable 'string' on a separate line, similarly to the list example.

    #Range Example:
for i in range(5):
    print(i) #This prints each integer in the range from 0 up until 5. So, it will print '0 1 2 3 4' on a separate line each.
#You can perform some actions for each element in that sequence, too. This can be used with if-elif-else loops inside of your for loop
    #Example:
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for number in numbers:
    if number == 0:
        print(f"{number} is zero")
    elif number % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{number} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is odd")

    #Dictionary Examples:
classmates = {
    "Billy":8,
    "Vance":12,
    "Alice":10,
    "Eliza":15,
    "Xavier":6}
for x in classmates:
    print(x) #This prints all the keys in the dictionary: Billy Vance Alice Eliza Xavier
#You can also print out the values:
for x in classmates.values():
    print(x) #This prints all the values: 8, 12, 10, 15, 6
#You can also print out both keys and values:
for x,y in classmates.items():
    print(x,y) #This prints out all sets of key:value pairs in the dictionary: Billy 8 Vance 12 Alice 10 Eliza 15 Xavier 6

#You can also use this to handle different types of data in a list.
    #Example:
elements = [1, "hello", 3.5, True, None, [1, 2, 3], {"key": "value"}]
for element in elements:
    if isinstance(element, bool):
        print(f"{element} is a boolean")
    elif isinstance(element, int):
        print(f"{element} is an integer")
    elif isinstance(element, str):
        print(f"{element} is a string")
    elif isinstance(element, float):
        print(f"{element} is a float")
    elif element is None:
        print(f"{element} is a NoneType")
    elif isinstance(element, list):
        print(f"{element} is a list")
    elif isinstance(element, dict):
        print(f"{element} is a dictionary")
    else:
        print(f"{element} is of an unknown type")

    #Check IF something is IN or NOT IN a sequence
    #Example 1:
lucky_list = ["horseshoe", "clover", "rabbit foot", "socks"]
if "clover" in lucky_list:
    print("clover is in lucky_list")

    #Example 2:
lucky_list = ["horseshoe", "clover", "rabbit foot", "socks"]
if "hat" not in lucky_list:
    print("hat is not in lucky_list")

    #While Loops
#While Loops are used when you want certain code to run while something is true. Think of a while loop as an if loop that repeats until a specific condition is met.
    #Example:
people_in_line = 20
while people_in_line > 1:
    print("There are " + str(people_in_line) + " people in line. Keep the coaster running!")
    people_in_line = people_in_line - 1
while people_in_line == 1:
    print("There is " + str(people_in_line) + " person in line. Keep the coaster running!")
    people_in_line = people_in_line - 1
#You need to be careful with using while loops. If you don't include a way for the condition to STOP being met, the code will just run on forever. The programmer MUST include a way to quit the loop. These are done with decrement and increment operators. If you don't include these, your code will run forever and that will lead to the program crashing.
    #Decrement Operator
#Notice how, in the above example, this piece of code is present:
"people_in_line = people_in_line - 1"
#Every time the loop runs, the variable named people_in_line is decreased by one. This means that the integer assigned to that variable will become smaller and smaller until the condition is met (aka people_in_line == 0).Once the condition is met, the loop will quit. This stops an infinite loop from happening.
#Here's another way of writing a decrement:
"people_in_line -= 1"
#This functions in essentially the same way as the above code example.
    #Increment Operator
#Increment operators work the same way as decrement operators, they simply add to the variable instead of subtracting.
    #Examples:
"people_in_line = people_in_line + 1"
"people_in_line += 1"

    #How to Stop Infinite Loops
#Don't worry if an infinite loop happens when testing! You just need to close the tab(s)/window(s) that your code is open and running in, and then add your increment or decrement operators before running that code again.
#Make sure to think about how to make sure the loop has a specified time and place to stop running.

    #If Loop In a While Loop
#You can add an if loop inside of a while loop! Make sure to pay attention to indentation, though.
    #Example:
age = 17
while age >= 0:
    if age == 5 or age == 10:
        print(age)
    age -= 1
